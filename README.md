# hw6-Weather-Dashboard

I am using 3 different Open Weather APIs for this website.
The weather api gives me the current weather information when provided with a city. The forecast api gives me the weather forecast for 5 days for a given city. The uvi api gives me the UV index of coordinates at various times. I use the lat and lon coordinates provided by the weather api and use them for the uvi api.
